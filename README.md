# React_TypeScript-RandomUserAPI

## PROJECT:

In this project, we display random users' profile pic, name, dob & city of residence. A very, very minimal <div> Title Button & UserData <div> display sandwiched btw <Header> & <Footer>. But cool logic for the button, that fetches data from https://randomuser.me/api . 

**See the final deployment** --> https://gcmo.github.io/React_TypeScript-RandomUserAPI/

## OBJECTIVE:
I've been focusing on TypeScript, as next challenge in JavaScript land. With this project, I wanted to challenge my TS skills within React.    

## LEARNING CURVE:
Typescript within React is pretty straight-fowards:
  a) **Rule of Thumb(ROT) 1:** just let it detect the type of a variable according to the value assigned.
  b) but what about {props} useState, useEffect and events? Welll... you just learn what type should be assigned to them. 
     Best resource for that: https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets
  c) **ROT2:** use interfaces for each component. Still have to decide whether its more efficient to have all the interfaces in their own file or just      associated with their respective component.
  d) Pay extra attention to API data... mostly doable with interface, but in some cases generics may work better. 
  
  
## CHALLENGES:
  props, state,
